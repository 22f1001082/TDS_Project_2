# Project 2 : Automated Anaalysis
## Overview
This a data analysis project that uses python to analyze a dataset and generate a report. The script accepts a dataset in CSV format, processes it, and generates insights and visualizations. The tool uses Python and integrates with OpenAI's models to generate narrative insights based on the data.

## Datasets Analyzed
The following datasets are analyzed in this project:
- **Goodreads Dataset**: Analysis of data on books from goodreads.
- **Media Dataset**: Media views, ratings, and genres analysis.
- **Happiness Dataset**: Analysis of happiness scores, income, education, and social support by country.

## Features
- **Automatic Data Loading**: Upload a dataset, and the system will load and analyze it.
- **Summary Statistics**: Automatically generates statistical summaries for numerical and categorical columns.
- **Visualizations**: Correlation heatmaps, outlier plot, and other insightful visualizations are generated and saved.
- **Narrative Generation**: Using OpenAIâ€™s API, the system creates a detailed narrative based on the analysis results.
